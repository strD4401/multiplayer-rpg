# Multiplayer RPG Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is a browser-based multiplayer RPG game with real-time player interaction, featuring a top-down 2D world where players can move around, interact with the environment, and communicate with each other. The game uses a client-server architecture with WebSockets for real-time communication.

## Architecture & Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React (v19) + TypeScript + Vite
- **Game Engine**: Phaser 3.88
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io
- **Backend**: Node.js Express server
- **Styling**: CSS with some Tailwind utility classes

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multiplayer Connectivity
- Real-time player position synchronization
- Player join/leave notifications
- Optimized network updates using position thresholds and debouncing

### 2. Player Movement System
- Keyboard controls (arrow keys)
- On-screen touch controls for mobile devices
- Physics-based movement with proper collision detection
- Player representation with different character sprites

### 3. Dynamic Chat System
- **Proximity Chat**: Talk to players within a specific range
- **Group Chat**: Create persistent conversations with multiple players
- **Chat Invitations**: Send, accept, or reject chat requests
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows which players are in chat range

### 4. Username Customization
- Editable player names
- Names displayed above player characters
- Random name generation on initial connection
- Server-side name synchronization

### 5. Responsive Game UI
- Adaptive layout that works on different screen sizes
- Chat overlay with proper interaction handling
- Username edit interface
- Optimized touch controls

### 6. Map System
- Tile-based world design
- Collision detection with environment
- Decorative elements and visual design

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Socket Connection Management
- **Challenge**: Multiple socket connections created during development due to React's strict mode and hot module reloading.
- **Solution**: Centralized socket connection in a dedicated service to maintain a singleton instance.

### 2. Player Movement Synchronization
- **Challenge**: Balancing network traffic vs. movement smoothness.
- **Solution**: Implemented a debounce mechanism and position-change thresholds to reduce unnecessary updates.

### 3. UI Interaction vs. Game Canvas
- **Challenge**: Making UI elements interactive while allowing game input to pass through.
- **Solution**: Used CSS `pointer-events` property strategically to control which elements can receive mouse/touch input.

### 4. Collision Detection with On-screen Controls
- **Challenge**: On-screen movement controls bypassed the physics engine's collision system.
- **Solution**: Modified the movement handler to use physics velocity instead of direct position changes.

### 5. Username Display Positioning
- **Challenge**: Names would become misaligned after text updates.
- **Solution**: Added proper text origin settings and ensured consistent updating.

### 6. Performance Optimization
- **Challenge**: Game became sluggish with multiple players and chat features.
- **Solution**: Memoized React functions, reduced re-renders, and optimized socket event handling.

### 7. Mobile Compatibility
- **Challenge**: Making the game playable on touch devices.
- **Solution**: Implemented touch-friendly controls and responsive layout adjustments.

## Code Structure

### Frontend Components
- **PhaserGame**: Main container component that initializes the game engine
- **GameScene**: Core game logic, player management, and physics handling
- **PreloadScene**: Asset loading and initialization
- **GameOverlay**: UI layer for chat and controls

### Backend Server
- Socket event handlers for player connections
- Real-time data synchronization
- Group chat management
- Player state tracking

## Future Improvements

1. **Game Persistence**: Save player progress and state
2. **Enhanced Map Features**: More interactive elements and larger world
3. **Character Customization**: Additional sprites and personalization options
4. **Game Mechanics**: Add RPG elements like items, quests, or abilities
5. **Performance**: Further optimizations for large player counts
6. **Administrative Tools**: Moderation features for chat and player management

## Development Lessons

1. Socket management is critical in real-time multiplayer games - centralize these connections
2. Plan UI/game canvas interaction carefully from the beginning
3. Implement debouncing early for network operations
4. Maintain a consistent approach to handling physics vs. direct position updates
5. Consider mobile users in the initial design, not as an afterthought
6. Use memoization and performance optimizations proactively
